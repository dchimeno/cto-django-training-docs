# Abstract

The Django course is a workshop to bring developers close to the Django philosophy, the way that it works and the common pitfalls every developer falls at least once by means of the creation of a project where people will be able to apply the different concepts addressed in the course. 

The only requirement is having a minimal knowledge of Python syntax. 

You will be able to learn how Django 2 works and how works its MVT based on Model, Views and Template. We will also put focus on the best-practices that we should follow in a Django project while creating a full project with some advanced techniques. 

We will create an API with Django and we will show how to create test for the entire application.
