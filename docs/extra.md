## Present and future of Django

Django has evolved in a way not too much frameworks have done in the last 15 years.

It has all the features it can have and is very mature and secure.

But new challenges arise:

* Microservices
* More and more speed required
* Websockets
* New async frameworks in python
* Running python is slower
* New languages
* No only SQL



FUTURE?:
